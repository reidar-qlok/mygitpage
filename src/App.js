        <p>
          Sweden is the largest country in the Nordic Region and has the biggest
          population. For many people, it is synonymous with flat-pack
          furniture, innovation, iron and steel. The country spends 3% of GDP on
          research and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweden shares land borders with Norway in the west and Finland in the
          northeast. It also has coasts facing its Nordic neighbours Denmark,
          Norway, Ã…land and Finland.
        </p>
